# Catppuccin Tmux

This repository is a fork of [tokyo-night-tmux](https://github.com/janoamaral/tokyo-night-tmux) by Logico. The license of that code was the MIT license, and is maintained in this repository through the `LICENSE.md` file. A huge thank you to their development efforts, whichout which this would not be possible.

The primary purpose of this repository is to take the visual outline of the tokyo-night-tmux plugin but change the colours and themes to be catppuccin. There is also the [tmux repository in the catppuccin organization](https://github.com/catppuccin/tmux) which you may also experiment with and decide on your preference.
